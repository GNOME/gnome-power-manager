msgid "The Suspend state is a power saving feature which is the lowest level of power consumption that preserves program data in the computer's memory. When your computer is in the Suspended state, computation will not be performed until normal activity is resumed. It will not resume until signaled by an external event such as a keyboard button press. It generally takes a few seconds to suspend and then resume your computer."

It will not resume until signaled by an external event such as a keyboard button press. This is the lowest power sleeping state available. If you remove AC power on a desktop, or run out of battery power on a laptop then work will not be lost. It can take up to a minute or more to hibernate and wake your computer."
