			      GNOME Power Manager
			   A Power Manager for GNOME

GNOME Power Manager is a GNOME session daemon that acts as a policy agent on top of
UPower, which requires fairly new versions of the kernel and udev.
GNOME Power Manager listens for system events and responds with user-configurable actions.

GNOME Power Manager comes in three main parts:

	- gnome-power-manager:	    the manager daemon itself
	- gnome-power-preferences:  the control panel program, for configuration
	- gnome-power-statistics:   the statistics graphing program

To build, GNOME Power Manager requires

	- Glib (2.13.0 or later)
	- Gtk2+ (2.11.0 or later)
	- GNOME Keyring (0.6.0 or later)
	- DBus (0.70 or later)
	- libnotify (0.4.3 or later)
	- libwnck (2.10.0 or later)

	- xrandr (1.2.0 or later)
	- Canberra (0.10 or later)
	- UPower (0.9.1 or later)
	- HAL (0.5.8 or later)

To work properly, gnome-power-manager requires udevd, upowerd and
udisks-daemon to be running.
